              " '23. _Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving\\nby allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies\\nto books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very\\nnumerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it\\nbrings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as\\nto their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\\nallowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\\nproper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\\nunusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\\nfound partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\\nnovels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\\nAbbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\\ncritical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\\nof burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\\ndifficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\\nin interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\\ndelicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\\ntheatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\\nwickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\\nEdmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\\nvery likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\\nyet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\\nothers have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\\nSensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\\nnot want them._',\n",
              " '24. _I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\\nwould, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\\nbook; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\\nAusten be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\\nof vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\\nmore popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\\nmore of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\\npeculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\\nEltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\\nI, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\\nseems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\\neminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\\nin such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\\ncause._',\n",
              " '25. _In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\\nreader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\\nwhen Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\\nfinished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\\n1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\\ncombination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\\ncritical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\\nsuperiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\\npossesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\\nregular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\\ncould be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\\nand Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\\nthéâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\\nstory earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\\nAll the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\\nCollins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\\nsame unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\\nhide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\\nFrank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\\nintrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\\nthe best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\\nalways liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\\nopportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\\nbe noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\\nnatural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\\nby Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\\nthe gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\\naversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\\nthe playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\\nsay that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\\ngarish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\\ndelicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\\ncertainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\\nwhich, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\\navail himself, appear at once on the stage._',\n",
              " '26. _I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\\nmore than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\\nmerit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\\nand graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\\nwill sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\\nconsciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\\nnovel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\\ndisplayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\\nfaculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\\nacted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\\nability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\\nshould put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\\nseem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\\nfaculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\\nThorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\\nbut who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\\nsuperior to them._',\n",
              " '27. _The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\\nthat they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\\nexpress, and at any particular time likely to be differently\\napprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\\ngreater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\\nthe numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\\nscheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\\nobvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\\nfor there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\\nJane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\\nmasculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\\ncommon subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\\navoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\\ncertain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\\nwho judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\\nsavagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\\nof Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\\nher immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\\nprotest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\\nrestrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\\nroasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\\nof course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\\nnineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\\nwould have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\\nhusband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\\ninnocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\\nat blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\\nof fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\\nMentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\\nwritten by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\\ndays of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\\nthink unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\\nown, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\\nher son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\\nEnglish language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\\nfalsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\\nsnarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\\nthe perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\\nbeneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\\nthat to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\\nevery man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\\nfool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\\na cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\\nhave been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\\ntook an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\\nwork her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\\nand I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\\nwas immensely the better for it as an artist._',\n",
              " '28. _In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\\nthat “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\\ncombined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\\nwe need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\\npainter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\\nterm miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\\nat one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\\nof Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\\nmyself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\\nmicrocosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\\nlittleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\\npaint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\\nfeel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\\nshort periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\\nmuch more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\\nsingle failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\\ncomposition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\\nanybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\\nseventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\\nrequired hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\\nGerman to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\\nEnglish girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\\nladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\\npierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\\ngravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\\nsubject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\\nMary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\\ntaste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\\ntouched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\\neven in a black one._',\n",
              " '29. _For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\\nonly genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\\nfirst head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\\ntrue, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\\nhas never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\\nthe false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\\nFrenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\\npiling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\\nnone; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\\nshape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\\nmyriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\\nNothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\\nonly) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.\\nBennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have\\nstirred the fire), when Mr. Darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_\\nhimself,” _the touch in each case is like that of Swift--“taller by the\\nbreadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\\njust and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\\nshould put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\\nto Addison in others._',\n",
              " '30. _This Swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears\\nnowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\\nCollins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\\never did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\\nbeen said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\\n_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\\nof prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\\ndistinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\\nto conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\\nthe end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\\npossess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\\ndraught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\\nformality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\\nis only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\\nCollins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\\n“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\\nside, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century\\nhumanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\\nits formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\\nits selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\\nor one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled\\nwith reality, and I should not wonder if many of these words and actions\\nare historically true._',\n",
              " '31. _But the greatness of Mr. Collins could not have been so satisfactorily\\nexhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the\\nfigures of Mr. Bennet and of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The latter, like\\nMr. Collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. There is,\\nperhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me\\nvery faint indeed. Even now I do not think that it would be impossible\\nto find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble\\nbirth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,\\nas Lady Catherine. A hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the Lady\\nPowerful (if not exactly Bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,\\nrich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of\\ndeveloping these agreeable characteristics which seldom present\\nthemselves now. As for Mr. Bennet, Miss Austen, and Mr. Darcy, and even\\nMiss Elizabeth herself, were, I am inclined to think, rather hard on him\\nfor the “impropriety” of his conduct. His wife was evidently, and must\\nalways have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her\\nor himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but\\nthe ironic. From no other point of view is he open to any reproach,\\nexcept for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of\\nthe elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the\\nconsciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that\\neven Miss Austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. It is\\ndifficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,\\nor when putting Mr. Collins through his paces; but the general sense of\\nthe world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his\\nconsolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “My dear,\\ndo not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things.\\nLet us flatter ourselves that_ I _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry\\nto his colossal cousin as to the compliments which Mr. Collins has just\\nrelated as made by himself to Lady Catherine, “May I ask whether these\\npleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the\\nresult of previous study?” These are the things which give Miss Austen’s\\nreaders the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by\\nthe readers of Swift, of Fielding, and we may here add, of Thackeray, as\\nthey are felt by the readers of no other English author of fiction\\noutside of these four._',\n",
              " '32. _The goodness of the minor characters in_ Pride and Prejudice _has been\\nalready alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties\\ndifficult in any space, and impossible in this. Mrs. Bennet we have\\nglanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely\\namusing or more horribly true. Much the same may be said of Kitty and\\nLydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have\\ndifferentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and\\nvulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common\\nweaknesses of woman at such different ages. With Mary, Miss Austen has\\ntaken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;\\nnot merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting\\ntraditional appendices which Mr. Austen Leigh has given us, in dooming\\nher privately to marry “one of Mr. Philips’s clerks.” The habits of\\nfirst copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and\\nsinging too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but\\nperhaps poor Mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings\\nin that Fordyce-belectured generation. It is at any rate difficult not\\nto extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and\\nrespect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards Mr.\\nCollins, when she draws the moral of Lydia’s fall. I sometimes wish\\nthat the exigencies of the story had permitted Miss Austen to unite\\nthese personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe\\npoor Mrs. Bennet’s anguish over the entail._',\n",
              " '33. _The Bingleys and the Gardiners and the Lucases, Miss Darcy and Miss de\\nBourgh, Jane, Wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,\\nfurther than the remark that Charlotte Lucas (her egregious papa, though\\ndelightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between\\ncomedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and\\nthat Wickham (though something of Miss Austen’s hesitation of touch in\\ndealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in\\ndrab of another. Only genius could have made Charlotte what she is, yet\\nnot disagreeable; Wickham what he is, without investing him either with\\na cheap Don Juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. But the\\nhero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._',\n",
              " '34. _Darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of\\nMiss Austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being Henry Tilney,\\nwhose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into\\ncomparison. It has sometimes, I believe, been urged that his pride is\\nunnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while\\nhis falling in love at all is not extremely probable. Here again I\\ncannot go with the objectors. Darcy’s own account of the way in which\\nhis pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and\\nnothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its\\nsudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of Elizabeth’s\\nscornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. Nothing in\\neven our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of\\nhis demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of Pemberley. Had he\\nbeen a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting\\nunder his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come\\nhusband-hunting. His being neither is exactly consistent with the\\nprobable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really\\ninjured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. As for his being in\\nlove, Elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that\\nphenomenon as Darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,\\nonly she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal\\ncharm._',\n",
              " '35. _The secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from Miss Austen\\nherself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather\\nto be felt than to be explained. Elizabeth of course belongs to the_\\nallegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of Venus. Miss Austen was\\nalways provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and\\nexcept the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate\\nsometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing\\nabout her looks. But her chief difference from other heroines of the\\nlively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost\\nstrong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and\\nsecondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her\\npropensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. Elizabeth can give\\nat least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never\\n“scratches,” and she never attacks first. Some of the merest\\nobsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early\\nspeeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to\\nserious business, as in the great proposal scene with Darcy (which is,\\nas it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the\\nfinal ladies’ battle with Lady Catherine, she is unexceptionable. Then\\ntoo she is a perfectly natural girl. She does not disguise from herself\\nor anybody that she resents Darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with\\nas personal a feeling. (By the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of\\nthis speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same\\nkind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have\\nbeen heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons\\nwho ought to have been no worse bred than Darcy.) And she lets the\\ninjury done to Jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family\\naggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._',\n",
              " '36. _Still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a\\ncommon form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her\\nplayfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a\\ncertain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.\\nNearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent\\nDarcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the\\nidea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating Wickham.\\nElizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the\\n“New Woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)\\nwomen have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea\\nthat all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with\\nher if they can. Though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”\\nshe has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. The form of\\npassion common and likely to seem natural in Miss Austen’s day was so\\ninvariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of\\nthese qualities, that she has not made Elizabeth outwardly passionate.\\nBut I, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have\\nmarried Darcy just as willingly without Pemberley as with it, and\\nanybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’\\nconversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked\\nto the Della Cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the Della\\nCruscans of this._',\n",
              " '37. _And, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of\\ncharm?--it is there. There were better sense in the sad mechanic\\nexercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. In\\nthe novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young\\nladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at\\nleast five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can\\nhelp doing so. Their names are, in chronological order, Elizabeth\\nBennet, Diana Vernon, Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and Barbara\\nGrant. I should have been most in love with Beatrix and Argemone; I\\nshould, I think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred Diana\\nand Barbara. But to live with and to marry, I do not know that any one\\nof the four can come into competition with Elizabeth._',\n",

You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”',\n",
              " '247. Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\nremained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story,\\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.',\n",
              " '248. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\nparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\ndistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her\\nmother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s\\npleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\nfortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\nwere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a\\nbook, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\nsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s\\nviews on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he\\nhad a very different story to hear.',\n",
              " '249. “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\\nJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\nher twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her\\ntwice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\ntime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\\nup with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\ndown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\nasked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss\\nKing, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane\\nagain, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”',\n",
              " '250. “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,\\n“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of\\nhis partners. O that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”',\n",
              " '251. “Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He\\nis so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never\\nin my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the\\nlace upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown----”',\n",
              " '252. Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\ndescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.',\n",
              " '253. “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\nall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited, that there was no enduring\\nhim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\ngreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”',\n",

              " '259. When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much\\nshe admired him.',\n",
              " '260. “He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners! so much ease,\\nwith such perfect good breeding!”',\n",
              " '261. “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought\\nlikewise to be if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”',\n",
              " '262. “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I\\ndid not expect such a compliment.”',\n",
              " '263. “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between\\nus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\\ncould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in\\nthe room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\\nstupider person.”',\n",
              " '264. “Dear Lizzy!”',\n",
              " '265. “Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\\nYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable\\nin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”',\n",
              " '266. “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak\\nwhat I think.”',\n",
              " '267. “I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_\\ngood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\\nothers! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it\\neverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the\\ngood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing\\nof the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,\\ntoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”',\n",
              " '268. “Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you\\nconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep\\nhis house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming\\nneighbour in her.”',\n",
              " '269. Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at\\nthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\\nmemories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been\\nacquired by trade.',\n",
              " '270. Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\\npurchase.',\n",
              " '271. His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\\nhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.',\n",
              " '272. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley\\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\\ngiving offence.',\n",
              " '273. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\\nmuch.',\n",
              " '274. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.',\n",

              " '280. Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\\nfriendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him\\ncourteous.',\n",
              " '281. Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\\nElizabeth’s intimate friend.',\n",
              " '282. That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.',\n",
              " '283. “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”',\n",
              " '284. “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”',\n",
              " '285. “Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\\nabout Mr. Robinson.”',\n",
              " '286. “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton\\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\\nanswering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”',\n",
              " '287. “Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”',\n",
              " '288. “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said\\nCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”',\n",
              " '289. “I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”',\n",

              " '293. “Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\\nspoke to.”',\n",
              " '294. “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much unless\\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\\nagreeable.”',\n",
              " '295. “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\\nto the ball in a hack chaise.”',\n",
              " '296. “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I\\nwish he had danced with Eliza.”',\n",

              " '299. “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride\\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\\nto be proud.”',\n",
              " '300. “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive\\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”',\n",
              " '301. “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\\nreflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”',\n",
              " '302. “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his\\nsisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”',\n",
              " '303. “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.\\nBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\\ndirectly.”',\n",

              " '311. The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit\\nwas returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the\\ngood-will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\\nfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\\na wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the\\ntwo eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest\\npleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of\\neverybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\\nthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,\\nin all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It\\nwas generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and\\nto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\\nwhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\\nway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\\nwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\\nunited with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an\\nuniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the\\nsuspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend, Miss\\nLucas.',\n",
              " '312. “It may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose\\non the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\\nso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\\nfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\\nit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the\\ndark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\\nattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”',\n",
              " '313. “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\\ndiscover it too.”',\n",
              " '314. “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”',\n",
              " '315. “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\\nit, he must find it out.”',\n",
              " '316. “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\\nin love as much as she chooses.”',\n",
              " '317. “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in\\nquestion but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined\\nto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\\nthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she\\ncannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its\\nreasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\\ndances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\\nand has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite\\nenough to make her understand his character.”',\n",
              " '318. “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\\nonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\\nremember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four\\nevenings may do a great deal.”',\n",
              " '319. “Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both\\nlike Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other\\nleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”',\n",
              " '320. “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\\nshe were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\\nchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\\ntwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\\nthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\\never so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\\nleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\\nhave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\\npossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\\nlife.”',\n",
              " '321. “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\\nsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”',\n",
              " '322. Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth\\nwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\\ninterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\\nallowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the\\nball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\\nsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had\\nhardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\nuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\\nthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\\ndetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\\nin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\\npleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\\nof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\\nthis she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made\\nhimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\\nto dance with.',\n",
              " '323. He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing\\nwith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\\ndrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were\\nassembled.',\n",
              " '324. “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my\\nconversation with Colonel Forster?”',\n",
              " '325. “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”',\n",
              " '326. “But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see\\nwhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\\nbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”',\n",

              " '328. On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\\nany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\\na subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\\nturned to him and said,--',\n",
              " '329. “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well\\njust now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\\nMeryton?”',\n",
              " '330. “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\\nenergetic.”',\n",
              " '331. “You are severe on us.”',\n",
              " '332. “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going\\nto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”',\n",
              " '333. “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\\nto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a\\nmusical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\\nreally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\\nhearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\\nshe added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\\nat Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\\nof course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\\nI shall keep mine to swell my song.”',\n",
              " '334. Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\\nor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\\nwould sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\\nsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\\nthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\\nimpatient for display.',\n",
              " '335. Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\\napplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\\nmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\\nhad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\\nmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\\nend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\\nScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\\nsome of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\\ndancing at one end of the room.',\n",
              " '336. Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\npassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\\nmuch engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\\nwas his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--',\n",
              " '337. “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\\nnothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\\nrefinements of polished societies.”',\n",
              " '338. “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\\nthe less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”',\n",
              " '339. Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\\ncontinued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\\nnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”',\n",
              " '340. “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”',\n",
              " '341. “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\\nyou often dance at St. James’s?”',\n",
              " '342. “Never, sir.”',\n",
              " '343. “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”',\n",
              " '344. “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”',\n",
              " '345. “You have a house in town, I conclude?”',\n",
              " '346. Mr. Darcy bowed.',\n",
              " '347. “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\\nsuperior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\\nLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”',\n",
              " '348. He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\\nmake any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\\nstruck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\\nher,--',\n",
              " '349. “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\\nme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\\ncannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\\nAnd, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\\nextremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\\ndrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--',\n",
              " '350. “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\\nnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”',\n",
              " '351. Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\\nher hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\\nall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.',\n",
              " '352. “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\\nthe happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\\namusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\\nfor one half hour.”',\n",
              " '353. “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.',\n",
              " '354. “He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\\ncannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\\npartner?”',\n",
              " '355. Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\\nher with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\\ncomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--',\n",
              " '356. “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”',\n",
              " '357. “I should imagine not.”',\n",
              " '358. “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\\nevenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\\nyour opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\\nnoise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\\npeople! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”',\n",
              " '359. “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\nagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\\nwhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”',\n",
              " '360. Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\\nwould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\\nMr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--',\n",
              " '361. “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”',\n",
              " '362. “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\\nHow long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\\njoy?”',\n",
              " '363. “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\\nimagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\\nto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”',\n",
              " '364. “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\\nabsolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\\nof course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”',\n",
              " '365. He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\\nentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\\nthat all was safe, her wit flowed along.',\n",

              " '373. Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\\nthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\\nin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\\nfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\\nthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\\nhad left her four thousand pounds.',\n",
              " '374. She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\\nfather and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\\nLondon in a respectable line of trade.',\n",
              " '375. The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\nconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\\nthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\\nto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\\nCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\\ntheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\\nbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\\nhours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\\nnews the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\\nsome from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\\nwith news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\\nthe neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\\nthe head-quarters.',\n",
              " '376. Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\\nintelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\\nofficers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\\nand at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\\nvisited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\\nunknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\\nBingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\\nmother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\\nan ensign.',\n",
              " '377. After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\\nBennet coolly observed,--',\n",
              " '378. “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\\nof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\\nI am now convinced.”',\n",
              " '379. Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\\nindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\\nher hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\\nnext morning to London.',\n",
              " '380. “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\\nready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\\nof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”',\n",
              " '381. “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”',\n",
              " '382. “Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”',\n",
              " '383. “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\\nhad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\\nso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\\nfoolish.”',\n",
              " '384. “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\\ntheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\\nnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\\nliked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\\nheart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\\nshould want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\\nColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\\nhis regimentals.”',\n",
              " '385. “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\\nCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\\ncame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”',\n",
              " '386. Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\\nnote for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\\nfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\\neagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--',\n",
              " '387. “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\\nJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”',\n",
              " '388. “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.',\n",

Come as soon as you can on the receipt of\\n     this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\\n     Yours ever,',\n",

              " '393. “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”',\n",
              " '394. “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.',\n",
              " '395. “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\\nrain; and then you must stay all night.”',\n",
              " '396. “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that\\nthey would not offer to send her home.”',\n",
              " '397. “Oh, but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton;\\nand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”',\n",
              " '398. “I had much rather go in the coach.”',\n",
              " '399. “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\\nwanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”',\n",
              " '400. [Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]',\n",
              " '401. “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”',\n",
              " '402. “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose\\nwill be answered.”',\n",
              " '403. She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\\nwere engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\\nmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad\\nday. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\\nrained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\\ndelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\\nJane certainly could not come back.',\n",
              " '404. “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--',\n",
              " '405. /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */',\n",
              " '406. “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\\n     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\\n     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\\n     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\\n     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\\n     headache, there is not much the matter with me.',\n",
              " '407. “Yours, etc.”',\n",
              " '408. “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\\naloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”',\n",
              " '409. “Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\\ncarriage.”',\n",
              " '410. Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.',\n",
              " '411. “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\\nthere.”',\n",
              " '412. “I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”',\n",
              " '413. “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\\nhorses?”',\n",
              " '414. “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”',\n",
              " '415. “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”',\n",
              " '416. “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\\ntogether.',\n",
              " '417. “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\\nsee something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”',\n",
              " '418. In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\\nof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\\nfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\\nover puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\\nwithin view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\\nglowing with the warmth of exercise.',\n",
              " '419. She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\\nassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\\nThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\\ndirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\\nMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\\nfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\\nbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\\ngood-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\\nnothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\\nbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\\nthe occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\nthinking only of his breakfast.',\n",
              " '420. Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\\nBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\\nenough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\\nimmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\\nalarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\\nfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\\nhowever, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\\ncould attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\\nextraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\\nher.',\n",
              " '421. When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\\nbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\\nsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\\nexamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\\nviolent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\\nadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\\nwas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\\nached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\\nthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\\nnothing to do elsewhere.',\n",
              " '422. When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\\nunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\\nwanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\\nat parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\\nof the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\\npresent. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\\ndespatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\\nback a supply of clothes.',\n",

              " '431. At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\\nElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\\npoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\\nmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\\nfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\\nthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\\nshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\\nbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\\nindifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\\nElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.',\n",
              " '432. Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\\nregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\\nattentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\\nherself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\\nothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\\nengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\\nHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\\neat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\\ndish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.',\n",
              " '433. When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\\nbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\\npronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\\nshe had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\\nthought the same, and added,--',\n",
              " '434. “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\\nwalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\\nlooked almost wild.”',\n",
              " '435. “She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\\nnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\\ncountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”',\n",
              " '436. “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\\nin mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\\nhide it not doing its office.”',\n",
              " '437. “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\\nall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\\nwhen she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\\nescaped my notice.”',\n",
              " '438. “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\\nan exhibition.”',\n",
              " '439. “Certainly not.”',\n",
              " '440. “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\\na most country-town indifference to decorum.”',\n",
              " '441. “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\\nBingley.',\n",
              " '442. “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\\neyes.”',\n",
              " '443. “Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--',\n",
              " '444. “I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\\nchance of it.”',\n",
              " '445. “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\nMeryton?”',\n",
              " '446. “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”',\n",
              " '447. “That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.',\n",
              " '448. “If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.”',\n",
              " '449. “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\\nconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.',\n",
              " '450. To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\\ntheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.',\n",
              " '451. With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\\nleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\\nShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\\nlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\\nwhen it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\\ndown stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.',\n",
              " '452. “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”',\n",

              " '454. “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”',\n",

              " '456. Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\\nothers; all that his library afforded.',\n",
              " '457. “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\\nthan I ever looked into.”',\n",
              " '458. Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\\nin the room.',\n",
              " '459. “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”',\n",
              " '460. “It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\\ngenerations.”',\n",
              " '461. “And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\\nbooks.”',\n",
              " '462. “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\\nthese.”',\n",
              " '463. “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.”',\n",
              " '464. “I wish it may.”',\n",
              " '465. “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”',\n",
              " '466. “With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”',\n",
              " '467. “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”',\n",
              " '468. “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”',\n",
              " '469. Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\\nsister, to observe the game.',\n",
              " '470. “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\\nshe be as tall as I am?”',\n",
              " '471. “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\\nrather taller.”',\n",
              " '472. “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”',\n",
              " '473. “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.”',\n",
              " '474. “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”',\n",
              " '475. “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\\nnet purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\\nsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\\nbeing informed that she was very accomplished.”',\n",
              " '476. “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\\nacquaintance that are really accomplished.”',\n",
              " '477. “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.',\n",
              " '478. “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\\nidea of an accomplished woman.”',\n",
              " '479. “Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”',\n",
              " '480. “Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\nwill be but half deserved.”',\n",
              " '481. “All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\\nsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\\nreading.”',\n",
              " '482. “I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”',\n",
              " '483. “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\\nthis?”',\n",
              " '484. “_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”',\n",
              " '485. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\\nroom.',\n",
              " '486. “Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\\nsex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\\nsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”',\n",
              " '487. “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\\n“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\\ndespicable.”',\n",
              " '488. Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\ncontinue the subject.',\n",
              " '489. Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for\\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\\nunwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\nhowever, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\\nhis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\\npossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.',\n",

              " '497. Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the\\nmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\\ninquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\\nand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\\nsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\\nnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\\nown judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and\\nits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\\ntwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.',\n",
              " '498. Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\\nvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\\nnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\\nrestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\\nwould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\\nhome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\\nit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\nBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\\nattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\\nthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.',\n",
              " '499. “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\\nmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\\na little longer on your kindness.”',\n",
              " '500. “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\\nsure, will not hear of her removal.”',\n",
              " '501. “You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\\n“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\\nremains with us.”',\n",
              " '502. Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.',\n",
              " '503. “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\\nknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\\nvast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\\nalways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\\ntemper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\\n_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\\nover that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\\nequal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\\nhope, though you have but a short lease.”',\n",
              " '504. “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\\nshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\\nminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”',\n",
              " '505. “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.',\n",
              " '506. “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.',\n",
              " '507. “Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”',\n",
              " '508. “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\\nthrough, I am afraid, is pitiful.”',\n",
              " '509. “That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”',\n",
              " '510. “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”',\n",
              " '511. “I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\\na studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”',\n",
              " '512. “Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\\nleast that advantage.”',\n",
              " '513. “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\\nsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\\nunvarying society.”',\n",
              " '514. “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\\nobserved in them for ever.”',\n",
              " '515. “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\\ncountry neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\\ngoing on in the country as in town.”',\n",
              " '516. Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\\nturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\\nvictory over him, continued her triumph,--',\n",
              " '517. “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\\npleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”',\n",
              " '518. “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\\nwhen I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”',\n",
              " '519. “Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\ngentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\\nat all.”',\n",
              " '520. “Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\\nmother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\\nyou must acknowledge to be true.”',\n",
              " '521. “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\\nmany people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\\nneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”',\n",
              " '522. Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\\ncountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\\nMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\\nsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\\nCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.',\n",
              " '523. “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\\nWilliam is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\\ngenteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\\nis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\\nimportant and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”',\n",
              " '524. “Did Charlotte dine with you?”',\n",
              " '525. “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\\nmy part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own\\nwork; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to\\njudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I\\nassure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think\\nCharlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”',\n",
              " '526. “She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.',\n",
              " '527. “Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\\nhas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast\\nof my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\\nbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\\npartiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my\\nbrother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my\\nsister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.\\nBut, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he\\nwrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”',\n",
              " '528. “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has\\nbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\\ndiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”',\n",
              " '529. “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.',\n",
              " '530. “Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”',\n",
              " '531. Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\\nindeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\\neach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.',\n",
              " '532. Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her\\nown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\\nvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\\nball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\\nthe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\\nto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.',\n",
              " '533. “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”',\n",
              " '534. Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to\\nwait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she\\nadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”',\n",
              " '535. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\\ninstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the\\nremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\\ncould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of\\nall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.',\n",

Mrs. Hurst and Miss\\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined\\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.',\n",
              " '542. Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.',\n",

              " '561. “My style of writing is very different from yours.”',\n",
              " '562. “Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way\\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”',\n",
              " '563. “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which\\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”',\n",
              " '564. “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”',\n",
              " '565. “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\\nindirect boast.”',\n",

The power of doing anything with\\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\\nBennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”',\n",
              " '568. “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the\\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”',\n",

Allowing the case, however, to\\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\\none argument in favour of its propriety.”',\n",
              " '575. “To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\\nwith you.”',\n",
              " '576. “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\\neither.”',\n",
              " '577. “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”',\n",
              " '578. “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\\nbetween the parties?”',\n",
              " '579. “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\\nforgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\\nknow a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\\nwhen he has nothing to do.”',\n",
              " '580. Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\\nrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\\nbrother for talking such nonsense.',\n",
              " '581. “I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\\nand want to silence this.”',\n",
              " '582. “Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”',\n",
              " '583. “What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.”',\n",
              " '584. Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.',\n",
              " '585. When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth\\nfor the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\\nthe pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\\nway, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\\nseated herself.',\n",
              " '586. Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\\nElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\\nthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\\non her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\\nadmiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\\nhe disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\\nat last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her\\nmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\\nany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\\nhim too little to care for his approbation.',\n",
              " '587. After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\\nlively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\\nElizabeth, said to her,--',\n",
              " '588. “Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an\\nopportunity of dancing a reel?”',\n",
              " '589. She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some\\nsurprise at her silence.',\n",
              " '590. “Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\\ndetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\\nthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\\ndelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\\ntheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\\nyou that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\\ndare.”',\n",
              " '591. “Indeed I do not dare.”',\n",
              " '592. Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\\ngallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\\nmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\\nnever been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\\nbelieved that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he\\nshould be in some danger.',\n",
              " '593. Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great\\nanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some\\nassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.',\n",
              " '594. She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of\\ntheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.',\n",
              " '595. “I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the\\nnext day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this\\ndesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;\\nand if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after\\nthe officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to\\ncheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,\\nwhich your lady possesses.”',\n",

They are in the same profession, you know, only in different\\nlines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it\\ntaken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”',\n",

              " '602. At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\nElizabeth herself.',\n",
              " '603. “I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some\\nconfusion, lest they had been overheard.',\n",
              " '604. “You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without\\ntelling us that you were coming out.”',\n",
              " '605. Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk\\nby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,\\nand immediately said,--',\n",
              " '606. “This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the\\navenue.”',\n",
              " '607. But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,\\nlaughingly answered,--',\n",
              " '608. “No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to\\nuncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a\\nfourth. Good-bye.”',\n",
              " '609. She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of\\nbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered\\nas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.',\n",

When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\\nseeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\\nwhere she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\\npleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were\\nduring the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\\nof conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\\nwith accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\\nacquaintance with spirit.',\n",
              " '618. But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\\nMiss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\\nsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\\nhimself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\\nalso made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\\nand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\\nattention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\\nshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\\nto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\\ndoor. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\\nElizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\\ndelight.',\n",
              " '619. When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\ncard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\\nDarcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\\npetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\\nsilence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\\nHurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the\\nsofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\\nand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\\nrings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\\nBennet.',\n",
              " '620. Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\\nDarcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\\nperpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\\nquestion and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\\nan excellent library.”',\n",
              " '621. No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\\ntowards him and said,--',\n",
              " '622. “By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\\nsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\\npleasure.”',\n",
              " '623. “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\\nchooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\\nthing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\\nround my cards.”',\n",
              " '624. “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\\nday.”',\n",
              " '625. “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\\nnear so much like a ball.”',\n",
              " '626. Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\\ndesperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\\nturning to Elizabeth, said,--',\n",
              " '627. “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\\nlong in one attitude.”',\n",
              " '628. Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\\ninterfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\nmeaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.',\n",
              " '629. “Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be\\nsevere on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\\nnothing about it.”',\n",
              " '630. Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\\nanything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\\ntwo motives.',\n",
              " '631. “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\\nas she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\\nthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret\\naffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\\nappear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\\ncompletely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\\nas I sit by the fire.”',\n",
              " '632. “Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\\nabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”',\n",
              " '633. “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\\ncan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\\nas you are, you must know how it is to be done.”',\n",
              " '634. “But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\\nyet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\\nno; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\\nourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\\nDarcy may hug himself.”',\n",
              " '635. “Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\\nuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\\nbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\\nlaugh.”',\n",
              " '636. “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. The\\nwisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\\nbe rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\\njoke.”',\n",
              " '637. “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am\\nnot one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\\nand nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\\nlaugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\\nyou are without.”',\n",
              " '638. “Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\\nunderstanding to ridicule.”',\n",
              " '639. “Such as vanity and pride.”',\n",
              " '640. “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\\nsuperiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”',\n",
              " '641. Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.',\n",
              " '642. “Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\\n“and pray what is the result?”',\n",
              " '643. “I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\\nhimself without disguise.”',\n",
              " '644. “No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\\nfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\\never.”',\n",
              " '645. “_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”',\n",
              " '646. “There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”',\n",
              " '647. “And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”',\n",
              " '648. “And yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand\\nthem.”',\n",
              " '649. “Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\nconversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my\\nwaking Mr. Hurst.”',\n",
              " '650. Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\nopened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for\\nit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.',\n",

But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\\nwould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive\\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\\nleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\\nwell. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\\ncontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at\\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.',\n",
              " '657. The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\\nJane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike\\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.',\n",
              " '658. The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\\nshe felt herself to be right.',\n",
              " '659. To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\\nBingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\\nwisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\\nshould _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.',\n",
              " '660. On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\\nall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits.',\n",
              " '661. They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet\\nwondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much\\ntrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their\\nfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really\\nglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The\\nevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its\\nanimation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and\\nElizabeth.',\n",

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\nexplained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a\\nfortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,\\nand requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,\\nwhen I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he\\npleases.”',\n",

              " '676. Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.\\nThey had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.\\nBennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail\\nbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of\\nfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.',\n",
              " '677. “It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and\\nnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.\\nBut if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little\\nsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.”',\n",

He was a tall,\\nheavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\\ndoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.

The\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\nown future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;\\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its\\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\\nhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good\\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a\\nquarter of an hour.',\n",

During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\\nto more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\\napprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\npeople, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\\ntwo to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.',\n",
              " '704. “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I\\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”',\n",

              " '708. “Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than\\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”',\n",
              " '709. “She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\\naccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”',\n",

              " '711. “Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\\nthe British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased\\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\npay.”',\n",
              " '712. “You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you\\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?”',\n",
              " '713. “They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.”',\n",

Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\\nexclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he\\nchose “Fordyce’s Sermons.” Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and\\nbefore he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\\ninterrupted him with,--',\n",

Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.\\nBennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s\\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\\nfor backgammon.',\n",

              " '728. Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of\\nhis life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\\nhad merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful\\nacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good\\ndeal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\\nprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\\nfelt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.',\n",
              " '729. Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.\\nThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s\\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\npart.',\n",
              " '730. His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\\nchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter\\nof an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at\\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to\\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her\\n_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to\\nhint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”',\n",
              " '731. Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally\\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.',\n",
              " '732. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\\nthe day before, was now high in her good graces.',\n",
              " '733. Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister\\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\\nhim after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the\\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,\\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\nthan a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and\\ngo.',\n",
              " '734. In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes\\nwere immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and\\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in\\na shop window, could recall them.',\n",
              " '735. But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\\nwith an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\\nMr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\\nhe bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\\nwondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\\nto find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\\nsomething in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\\npavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\\nspot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\\nWhat could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\\nimpossible not to long to know.',\n",
              " '736. In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.',\n",
              " '737. Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\\nMr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s\\npressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.\\nPhilips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the\\ninvitation.',\n",
              " '738. Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\\ntheir recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\\nexpressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\\ncarriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\\nshe had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had\\ntold her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\\nbecause the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\\ntowards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\\napologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\\nher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\\nappeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\\ndisagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\\nwith unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.',\n",
              " '739. As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or\\nboth, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such\\nbehaviour than her sister.',\n",
              " '740. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.\\nPhilips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for\\nshe had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even\\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\\nutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.',\n",

As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their\\naunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the\\ngirls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in\\nthe house.',\n",
              " '747. When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\\nwith the housekeeper’s room.',\n",

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\\nsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\\ninterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.\\nThe gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The\\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\\ngentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\\nMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.',\n",

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\\nskill of the speaker.',\n",
              " '753. With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.',\n",
              " '754. When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\\nin return, by sitting down to whist.',\n",
              " '755. “I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.',\n",
              " '756. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\\nmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.',\n",
              " '757. “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\ndrop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\nunderstand.”',\n",
              " '758. “Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\\nconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”',\n",
              " '759. Elizabeth could not but look surprised.',\n",
              " '760. “You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”',\n",
              " '761. “As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent\\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\ndisagreeable.”',\n",
              " '762. “I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\nastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”',\n",
              " '763. “Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”',\n",
              " '764. “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\\ninterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”',\n",
              " '765. “I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\nill-tempered man.”',\n",
              " '766. Wickham only shook his head.',\n",
              " '767. “I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.”',\n",
              " '768. “I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\nwas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”',\n",
              " '769. “Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\nmemory of his father.”',\n",
              " '770. Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.',\n",
              " '771. Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\\nvery intelligible gallantry.',\n",
              " '772. “It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\\n“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\nwere speaking of just now.”',\n",
              " '773. “Indeed!”',\n",
              " '774. “Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\nelsewhere.”',\n",
              " '775. “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his\\nwill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”',\n",
              " '776. “There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\\nCertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\nfreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”',\n",
              " '777. “This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”',\n",
              " '778. “Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”',\n",
              " '779. Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\never as he expressed them.',\n",
              " '780. “But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can\\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”',\n",
              " '781. “A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\nof preference which was often given me.”',\n",
              " '782. “I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\nthis!”',\n",
              " '783. After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\\nmust be dreadful.”',\n",
              " '784. “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\\nhardly be just to him.”',\n",
              " '785. Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\\nwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\\nmanner.”',\n",
              " '786. “We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\npart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\\nappears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\\nPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\\nand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\\nto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”',\n",
              " '787. “How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\\ndishonesty I must call it.”',\n",
              " '788. “It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\nimpulses even than pride.”',\n",
              " '789. “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”',\n",
              " '790. “Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\\nfather was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.”',\n",
              " '791. “What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”',\n",
              " '792. He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\neducation.”',\n",
              " '793. After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying,--',\n",
              " '794. “I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\\nwho seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\nbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\\nknow Mr. Bingley?”',\n",
              " '795. “Not at all.”',\n",
              " '796. “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\\nDarcy is.”',\n",
              " '797. “Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\\nwant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\nhis while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\\nvery different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\\nnever deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\\nsincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing\\nsomething for fortune and figure.”',\n",
              " '798. The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\nthe other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\nElizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\\nher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\\nmake herself uneasy.',\n",
              " '799. “I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\\ncard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\\nare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\nlittle matters.”',\n",
              " '800. Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.',\n",
              " '801. “Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”',\n",
              " '802. “You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”',\n",
              " '803. “No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\nyesterday.”',\n",
              " '804. “Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”',\n",
              " '805. This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\nself-destined to another.',\n",
              " '806. “Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\ndaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her\\nLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\\nher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”',\n",
              " '807. “I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have\\nnot seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\\nchooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\\nthe first class.”',\n",
              " '808. Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\\nan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\nWickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of\\nMrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to\\neverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\ngracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as\\nthey went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and\\nMrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.',\n",
              " '810. [Illustration:',\n",
              " '811. “delighted to see their dear friend again”\\n]',\n",
              " '813. CHAPTER XVII.',\n",
              " '814. [Illustration]',\n",
              " '815. Elizabeth related to Jane, the next day, what had passed between Mr.\\nWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern: she\\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\nBingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the\\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\\npossibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to\\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be\\ndone but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and\\nthrow into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\\notherwise explained.',\n",
              " '816. “They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way or\\nother, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps\\nmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to\\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\\nwithout actual blame on either side.”',\n",
              " '817. “Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in\\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\\nbusiness? Do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\\nsomebody.”',\n",
              " '818. “Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\nopinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a\\nmanner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\\nimpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\\ncharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so\\nexcessively deceived in him? Oh no.”',\n",
              " '819. “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that\\nMr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last\\nnight; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not\\nso, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”',\n",
              " '820. “It is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to\\nthink.”',\n",
              " '821. “I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”',\n",
              " '822. But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.\\nBingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when\\nthe affair became public.',\n",
              " '823. The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\nconversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom\\nthey had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their\\npersonal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was\\nfixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see\\ntheir dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and\\nrepeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their\\nseparation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;\\navoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,\\nand nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from\\ntheir seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\\nhurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.',\n",
              " '824. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\nfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by\\nreceiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\\nceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look\\nand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\\nless on any single event, or any particular person; for though they\\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\\nwas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she\\nhad no disinclination for it.',\n",
              " '825. “While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I\\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.\\nSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who\\nconsider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\\neverybody.”',\n",
              " '826. Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did\\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he\\ndid, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s\\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,\\neither from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\\ndance.',\n",
              " '827. “I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of\\nthis kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can\\nhave any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a\\npreference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.”',\n",
              " '828. Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being\\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\\ninstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce\\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as\\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.',\n",
              " '829. If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;\\nfor, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was\\nsuch a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No\\naunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses\\nfor Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some\\ntrial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement\\nof her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on\\nTuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday\\nendurable to Kitty and Lydia.',\n",
              " '831. [Illustration]',\n",
              " '833. CHAPTER XVIII.',\n",
              " '834. [Illustration]',\n",
              " '835. Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of\\nmeeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than\\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\\nmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\\ndreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s\\npleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this\\nwas not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\\npronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and\\nwho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business\\nthe day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant\\nsmile,--',\n",
              " '836. “I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\\nhe had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”',\n",
              " '837. This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\nElizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\nWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling\\nof displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\\nAttention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.',\n",
              " '838. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\nspirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she\\nhad not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary\\ntransition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her\\nparticular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of\\ndistress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and\\nsolemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong\\nwithout being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\\ndisagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her\\nrelease from him was ecstasy.',\n",
              " '839. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took\\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without\\nknowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\\nmind: Charlotte tried to console her.',\n",
              " '840. “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”',\n",
              " '841. “Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find\\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an\\nevil.”',\n",
              " '842. When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\nin the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\nreading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\\nwith--',\n",
              " '843. “It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\\ndance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\\nroom, or the number of couples.”',\n",
              " '844. He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\nsaid.',\n",
              " '845. “Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\\n_now_ we may be silent.”',\n",
              " '846. “Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”',\n",
              " '847. “Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.”',\n",
              " '848. “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?”',\n",
              " '849. “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\nposterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”',\n",
              " '850. “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\\nsaid he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”',\n",
              " '851. “I must not decide on my own performance.”',\n",
              " '852. He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\\nthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.”',\n",
              " '853. The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\nconstrained manner said,--',\n",
              " '854. “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\\n_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\\nis less certain.”',\n",
              " '855. “He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\\nwith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\nhis life.”',\n",
              " '856. Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\\nDarcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\\nhis dancing and his partner.',\n",
              " '857. “I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\\nat her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”',\n",
              " '858. [Illustration:',\n",
              " '859. “Such very superior dancing is not\\noften seen.”',\n",

              " '861. The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\nWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--',\n",
              " '862. “Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking\\nof.”',\n",
              " '863. “I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\\nthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”',\n",
              " '864. “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.',\n",
              " '865. “Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\nfeelings.”',\n",
              " '866. “I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”',\n",
              " '867. “No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\nsomething else.”',\n",
              " '868. “The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,\\nwith a look of doubt.',\n",
              " '869. “Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\nthat you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\ncreated_?”',\n",
              " '870. “I am,” said he, with a firm voice.',\n",
              " '871. “And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”',\n",
              " '872. “I hope not.”',\n",
              " '873. “It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.”',\n",
              " '874. “May I ask to what these questions tend?”',\n",
              " '875. “Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring\\nto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”',\n",
              " '876. “And what is your success?”',\n",
              " '877. She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”',\n",
              " '878. “I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”',\n",
              " '879. “But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\nopportunity.”',\n",
              " '880. “I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\\nsilence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\\nin Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\\nwhich soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\\nanother.',\n",
              " '881. They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\\nwith an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--',\n",
              " '882. “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\\nYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\nquestions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\\nother communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\\nDarcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\\nimplicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\\nhim ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\\nremarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\\nmost infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\\nwell that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\\nto hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\\ncould not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\nwas excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\\nHis coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\\nI wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\\ndiscovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\\ndescent, one could not expect much better.”',\n",
              " '883. “His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\\nsaid Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\\nworse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\\nassure you, he informed me himself.”',\n",
              " '884. “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\\n“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”',\n",
              " '885. “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\\nyou expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\\nDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\\nElizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\\nfor Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\\nway before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.',\n",
              " '886. “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\nsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\\nyou may be sure of my pardon.”',\n",
              " '887. “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\nsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\\nhistory, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\nthe probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\nreceived; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\\nsister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\\nafraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\\nregard.”',\n",
              " '888. “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”',\n",
              " '889. “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”',\n",
              " '890. “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\nperfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”',\n",
              " '891. “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\nhim _conditionally_ only.”',\n",
              " '892. “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\\n“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\\nBingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\\nboth gentlemen as I did before.”',\n",
              " '893. She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\\ndelight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\\nBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\\nin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\nand told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\\nas to make a most important discovery.',\n",
              " '894. “I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\\nin the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\nthis house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\\nLady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\\nhave thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\nBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\\nand trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”',\n",
              " '895. “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”',\n",
              " '896. “Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\\nI believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\\nassure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”',\n",
              " '897. Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\\nan impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\\nwas not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\nside, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\\nthe determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\\nspeaking, replied thus,--',\n",
              " '898. “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\\nexcellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\\nunderstanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\\nbetween the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those\\nwhich regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\\nthe clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\\nin the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\\nsame time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\\ndictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\\nwhat I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\\nyour advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\\nthough in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\\nand habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\\nyourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\\nreception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\\nbeing so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\\na solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\\nhearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\\n“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\\nexpose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\nunrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\\nreplied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\\ndiscouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.',\n",
              " '899. “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\\nreception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\\nhandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”',\n",
              " '900. As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\\nher perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\\nvery house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\\nbestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\\neven to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\\nsaw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\\nlest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\\nshe considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\\none of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\\ntalking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\\nelse but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\\nBingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\\nof fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\\na charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\\nwere the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\\ncomfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\\ncertain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\\nwas, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\\nJane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\\nand, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\\nconsign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\\nnot be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\\nto make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\\noccasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\nBennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\nchance of it.',\n",
              " '901. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s\\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\nwhisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.',\n",
              " '902. “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.”',\n",
              " '903. “For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you\\nto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\nso doing.”',\n",
              " '904. Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\\nblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\nsteady gravity.',\n",
              " '905. At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\\nElizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\\ntranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\\nhad the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\npreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\\nentreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\\ncomplaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\\nopportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\\nElizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\\nshe watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\\nwhich was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\\namongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\\nprevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\\nbegan another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\\nher voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\\nShe looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\\ntalking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\\nsigns of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\nimpenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\\nand, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--',\n",
              " '906. “That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\\nLet the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”',\n",
              " '907. Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\\nher anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.',\n",
              " '908. “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\\nmusic, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\\nrector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\\nan agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\noffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\nas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\\neverybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\\ncannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\\nshould omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\\nconnected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\\nhis speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\\nroom. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\\nBennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\\nhaving spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\\nLucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.',\n",
              " '909. To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\nmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\\nshe could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\\nthe insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.',\n",
              " '910. The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\\ncould not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\npower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\nsomebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\\nroom. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\\nto it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\\nhimself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\\nclose to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\\nproject. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\\noften joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\\nto herself.',\n",

She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\nit.',\n",

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\\nmanœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\\nhour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\\nspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\\nhow tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.',\n",
              " '913. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\\npleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\\nwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\\ngo the next day for a short time.',\n",
              " '914. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.',\n",

              " '921. The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\\ndeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\\nmoment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\nobservances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\\nMrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\\nafter breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--',\n",
              " '922. “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\ncourse of this morning?”',\n",
              " '923. Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\nBennet instantly answered,--',\n",
              " '924. “Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\\nshe can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\\ngathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\\ncalled out,--',\n",
              " '925. “Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\\nme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am\\ngoing away myself.”',\n",
              " '926. “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And\\nupon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about\\nto escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing\\nMr. Collins.”',\n",
              " '927. Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s\\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\\nto conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\\nbetween distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\\nsoon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--',\n",
              " '928. “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\\nmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”',\n",
              " '929. The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\\nhe continued,--',\n",
              " '930. “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\\nvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\\nhave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\nleft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\narranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\nin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”',\n",
              " '931. It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.',\n",
              " '932. “You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\\nanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\\nthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\\nthem.”',\n",
              " '933. “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\nhand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\\njust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”',\n",
              " '934. “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\nwould make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\nsituation.”',\n",
              " '935. “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\\nvery gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.”',\n",
              " '936. “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\\nbelieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\\naddressed her,--',\n",
              " '937. “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\\nfirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\nfemale character.”',\n",
              " '938. “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\nmay convince you of its being one.”',\n",
              " '939. “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\nrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\\nis unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer\\nwould be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my\\nconnections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your\\nown, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into\\nfurther consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\\nby no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\\nYour portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo\\nthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\\ntherefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”',\n",
              " '940. “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\\ntruth from her heart.”',\n",
              " '941. “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\\ngallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\nbeing acceptable.”',\n",
              " '942. To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.',\n",

Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.',\n",
              " '949. This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been\\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\\nand could not help saying so.',\n",
              " '950. “But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\\na very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\\nI will _make_ her know it.”',\n",
              " '951. “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she\\nis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\\nforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”',\n",
              " '952. “Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”',\n",

The envelope contained a\\nsheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\\nJane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\\njoin, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they\\nhad gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\\nfrom Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\\nThe whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\\nto town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\\nwhat she says.”',\n",
              " '998. She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\\nregret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\\ndearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\\nreturns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\\nmeanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these\\nhigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\\nsaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\\ncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.',\n",
              " '999. “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\\nhope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\nthem.”',\n",
              " '1000. “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.',\n",
              " '1001. “‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\\nalready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\\nwhom we shall deprive you.’',\n",

I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\\nimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\\nless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\\nher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\\nshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\\nmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\\nyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\ncapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\nof so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\\nJane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\\ndeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\\nthat she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\\nif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\\nkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\\nsubject?”',\n",
              " '1005. “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”',\n",
              " '1006. “Most willingly.”',\n",
              " '1007. “You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\nin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\ndoes not care about you.”',\n",
              " '1008. Jane shook her head.',\n",
              " '1009. “Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\\ntogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\\ncase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\\nthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\\ndare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\\ndearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\nTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”',\n",
              " '1010. “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\\nherself.”',\n",
              " '1011. “That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\nwill not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”',\n",
              " '1012. “But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\nelsewhere?”',\n",
              " '1013. “You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,\\nby all means, to refuse him.”',\n",
              " '1014. “How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\nnot hesitate.”',\n",

              " '1017. The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\\ninterested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\nso totally independent of everyone.',\n",
              " '1018. She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\\nJane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\nBingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.',\n",
              " '1019. They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\\nthinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\\nLongbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\\nthat, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\\ncare to have two full courses.',\n",

The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\\nchief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\\nElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\\nhumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”',\n",
              " '1026. Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\\nvery amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\\nhad any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\\nherself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\\nsure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\\nBut here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\\ncharacter; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\\nhimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\\nreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.',\n",
              " '1027. In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\\nthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\nestablishment were gained.',\n",
              " '1028. Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\\nexceedingly fair.

The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\\noccasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\\nsooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\\nfrom their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\\nherself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\\nto consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\\nCollins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\\nirksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\\nbe her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\\nmarriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\\nprovision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\\nuncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\\nfrom want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\\ntwenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\\nluck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\\nsurprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\\nvalued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\\nprobably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\\nto give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\npassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\\nquestions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\npublish his prosperous love.',\n",
              " '1033. As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\\nthe family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\\nmoved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\\ncordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,\\nwhenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.',\n",
              " '1034. “My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\\nmay be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\npossible.”',\n",
              " '1035. They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\\nso speedy a return, immediately said,--',\n",
              " '1036. “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my\\ngood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\\noffending your patroness.”',\n",
              " '1037. “My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you\\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\\nmaterial a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”',\n",
              " '1038. “You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her\\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”',\n",
              " '1039. “Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\naffectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive\\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of\\nyour regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,\\nthough my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall\\nnow take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting\\nmy cousin Elizabeth.”',\n",
              " '1040. With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\\nsurprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished\\nto understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of\\nher younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\\nShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a\\nsolidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no\\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and\\nimprove himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\nagreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this\\nkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.',\n",
              " '1041. The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but\\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility\\nas that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was\\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\\nshe could not help crying out,--',\n",
              " '1042. “Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”',\n",
              " '1043. The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\\nstory gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\\nher composure, and calmly replied,--',\n",
              " '1044. “Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,\\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”',\n",
              " '1045. But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort\\nfor it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the\\nprospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she\\nwished her all imaginable happiness.',\n",
              " '1046. “I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,\\nvery much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.\\nBut when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be\\nsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never\\nwas. I ask only a comfortable home; and, considering Mr. Collins’s\\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\nentering the marriage state.”',\n",
              " '1047. Elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,\\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\\nlonger; and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers\\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\naccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was\\nnot exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible\\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\nfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was a\\nmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing\\nherself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot\\nshe had chosen.',\n",
